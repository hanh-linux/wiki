### You've reached Hanh Linux on GitHub. 
Hanh Linux is an Artix-based with pure x64 libraries Linux distribution. For further infomation, check out: [Basic:Hanh Linux](https://github.com/hanhlinux/hanhlinux/wiki/Basic:Hanh-Linux)


Currently, we are moving from Artix-based GNU/Linux to an independent Linux distribution with less GNU components so the project will be temporarily closed for it. But the social media will be continued so feel free to join our chat group.
