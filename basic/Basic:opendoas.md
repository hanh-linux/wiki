Portable version of OpenBSD's `doas` for running command that must be done by using `root` permission. It is a lightweight replacements of `sudo`.
### Installation
By default, `opendoas` is installed in Hanh Linux.
### Usage
Like `sudo`, just use: 
``````````
doas <command>
``````````
For dropping a shell using `root`, use: 
``````````
doas -s
``````````
### Configuration
Check out `/etc/doas.conf`. By default, group `wheel` is added to the configuration file.
> For a specified user, just replace `:<group>` with `<user>`
>
The syntax is: 
````````````
permit :<group>
deny :<group>
````````````
If you want to execute `doas` without asking password, add:
````
permit nopass :<group>
````
> It is not recommended to run `doas` with no password
> 
Disable `doas` requires password in five minutes after last password input, add this line to the configuration file: 
```````````````
permist persist :<group>
```````````````
To allow a group or deny it from running a command, add this line to the configuration file:
`````````````````
permit :<group> cmd <command>
deny :<group> cmd <command>
````````````````` 
To check if the configuration contains any syntax error, do: 
`````````````````
doas -C <configuration> && echo "Success" | echo "Error"
`````````````````
For more information, check out `doas` and `doas.conf` manpage or see the links below.
